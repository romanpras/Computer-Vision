Global Wheat Detection competition from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection/overview)


Attempting to predict bounding boxes around each wheat head in images that have them. If there are no wheat heads, I must predict no bounding boxes.

1. Start from the first notebook - FinalProjetCVFasterRCNN.
2. Then move on to the second notebook - FinalProjetCVEfficientDet.

Thanks
